![WhatsApp Image 2025-09-05 at 12 42 00_4d296c5e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fedbc010-b66d-4c0a-9994-7ff7203a6166)
The **Gym Management System (GMS)** is a web-based application designed to automate and streamline the management of gym facilities, including gym branches, members, trainers, and payment processing.  

Traditionally, gym operations such as member registration, trainer allocation, and payment tracking were handled manually, leading to inefficiency, errors, and difficulties in maintaining records. This system eliminates these issues by providing a centralized digital solution.  

The proposed system enables administrators to add and manage multiple gym branches with detailed information including name, address, and type. Payment departments are directly linked to gyms to ensure smooth financial tracking. The payment module records fee amounts, associates payments with gyms, and links them to trainers and members for accountability.  

Members are registered into the system with details such as name, age, date of birth, package type, mobile number, and associated payment and trainer IDs. Trainers are also managed within the system, with records containing schedules, contact details, and payment details.  

The system ensures **data integrity** through relational database constraints (foreign keys), preventing invalid references. For example, a member cannot be added unless a valid payment ID and trainer ID exist in the database. This design guarantees consistency across modules.  

The GMS is built using:
- **PHP** for backend development  
- **MySQL** for database management  
- **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap** for frontend design  
- **phpMyAdmin** as a database management tool  
- **XAMPP** as a local development environment  

By implementing this system, gym operations are significantly simplified: administrators can monitor payments, track trainer allocations, register new members, and ensure proper linkages between all entities. It supports **scalability** for multiple gym branches and can be extended with additional modules such as **attendance tracking, workout plans, and performance analytics.**

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Gym Module** – Add/view gyms and their details.  
- **Payment Module** – Manage payments per gym, allocate to members and trainers.  
- **Member Module** – Register members, link to trainers and payments, manage packages.  
- **Trainer Module** – Add/view trainers, assign to members, link payment records.  
- **Authentication Module** – Admin login for secure access.  

---

## 🎯 Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates manual record-keeping  
- ✅ Ensures accuracy via foreign key constraints  
- ✅ Provides centralized management of gyms, payments, trainers, and members  
- ✅ Scalable and adaptable for multiple branches
